Below are notes I took along the way of things I wanted to remember most when reading this series. You may also see code snippets of me practicing things as well, usually in some way related to a project I'm working on.

# General Notes
`==` checks for value equality with coercion allowed and `===` checks for value equality without allowing coercion.

The `let` variable allows you to declare variables to belong to individual blocks (i.e. allowing a variable to only be part of a for loop, but not the entire function it is in).

> “Strict mode is a big win for code, and you should use it for all your programs. You can opt in to strict mode for an individual function, or an entire file, depending on where you put the strict mode pragma.” – Kyle

# Scopes and Closures
## Module Pattern (scopes and closures)
> Closure is perhaps the single most important concept in all of JS, but if you haven't first grasped firmly how scope works, closure will likely remain beyond your grasp.

> The module pattern is perhaps the most prevalent code organization pattern in all of JavaScript; deep understanding of it should be one of your highest priorities.

# this & Object Prototypes
Need to focus on truly understanding behavior delegation and what fundamentally differentiates it from classes and inheritance.

# Types & Grammar
>  Perhaps no topic causes more frustration with JS developers than when you talk about the confusions surrounding implicit coercion.

**If I understand this topic well then I should consider myself doing well.**

# Async & Performance
It looks like I need to fundamentally understand callbacks, although ES6 has me covered with promises and generators.

> But it's the combination of promises and generators that "yields" our most effective asynchronous coding pattern to date in JavaScript. In fact, much of the future sophistication of asynchrony coming in ES7 and later will certainly be built on this foundation. To be serious about programming effectively in an async world, you're going to need to get really comfortable with combining promises and generators.

**If I understand this topic well, then I should consider myself doing well.**

# ES6 & Beyond
I need to understand the high-level differences between ES5, ES6, and ES7. **If I can explain these to someone else from memory, I should consider myself doing well.**
